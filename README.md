# What's New!

Well to put it simply... the original OSJR had no paint.

And now it does! Included is some very basic paint Listeners:
- Agility Overlay (Currently only supports Al Kharid and Varrock)
- Actor Names Overlay (Players and NPC's)
- Fishing Overlay
- Various Object ID overlays under Settings

### Discord Rich Presence
- Users can set a custom status under Discord > Update status.
- Will inform how long a user has been logged in or out.

### Hooks are once again included.

- If you are really interested in knowing how I get them, take a look at my Runelite fork commits. 

### No release is supported at this time.
- if you want to use this. Build it and run it using Eclipse. It is not ready for a runnable Jar release.
