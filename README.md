-OSJR repo changes are also listed in discord now.

### Hooks are once again included.

- If you are really interested in knowing how I get them, take a look at my Runelite fork commits. 

### No release is supported at this time.
- if you want to use this. I have included a courtesy export folder. OSJR, gamepack, and Hooks.json need to be in the same directory currently.
