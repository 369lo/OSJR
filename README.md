# OS-JR


OS-JR is a lightweight OSRS Reflection client.

  - Revision 159 compliant
  - Hooks updated regularly
  - Auto gamepack updater
  - Instant startup time

# New Features!

  - Added most hooks courtesy of the boys at https://github.com/KyleHunter/OSR-Reflection - Fantastic code check it out!


The plan:
  - Make a simple open source reflection interface for OSRS using java.
  - Finish implementing getters for the hooks. Presently they can all be called manualy.
